# Tyler's React Portfolio

## Description
  This website is a culmination of my time here in the UDX bootcamp as a bootcamp student. This is my personal portfolio made with react to display my skills as a web developer. Throughout the site, I use the same color palette, text, and I try to keep the theme of all the pages similar to one another while maintaining a unique feel for each page. On this site, you'll be able to download my resum√©, fill out a contact form, and browse some of my past work. Feel free to drop me a message here, or on one of my social networking sites that are provided in the footer. I hope you enjoy my portfolio and are able to learn just a little bit about me!

## Usage
This is my professional portfolio (will continue to be updated as I do more things) and it is inteded to be used as such. This portfolio contains information about myself and some of the previous work I have accomplished thus far. This was also a homework assignment for the bootcamp I attended, so it was also used for grading purposes.
